# Multiples_of_3_and_5
the program should return the sum of multiples the number 3 and the number 5 for any given number
as an example: the sumation of Multiples_of_3_and_5(10) will return 23 because all the natural numbers
below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
